# GuitarTeacher Project Rules

## Core Principles
- Follow Expo and React Native best practices
- Always use TypeScript
- Keep solutions simple and maintainable
- Write clean, readable code over clever code

## Code Quality
- Use functional components with hooks
- Use arrow functions
- Implement proper TypeScript types for all props and state
- Follow React Native's performance best practices
- Ignore linter issues unrelated to the current task
- Use proper naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components)
- Remove empty lines and keep code condensed for better readability
- Comments only for complex logic and non-obvious decisions
- Group code elements (imports, enums, etc.) logically first, then alphabetically

## Problem Solving
- When encountering a "hacky" solution, step back and reassess using first principles
- Ask for clarification before implementing non-obvious solutions
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios
- Document technical decisions and their rationale

## Folder Structure
- `/app` - Expo Router app directory for routing and screens
  - `/(tabs)` - Tab-based navigation screens
  - `_layout.tsx` - Root layout configuration
- `/src` - Source code directory
  - `/constants` - App-wide constants and configuration
  - `/utils` - Helper functions and utilities
- `/assets` - Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
- `/ios` - iOS native code
- `/android` - Android native code
- Root configuration files (app.json, package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
